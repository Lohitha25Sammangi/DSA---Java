Pragramming Language : A programming language is a set of instructions and syntax used to create software programs. Programming Languages build a communiction between user and a computer.
Types of Programming Languages: 
1. Procedural: 
       -> A series of well structured steps and statements to compose a program.
       -> contains  a systematic order of statements and rule to complete a task.
2. Functional: 
       -> writing a program by using only pure functions.
       -> used in a situation where a lot of operations are performed on the same data like ML.
3. OOP(Object Oriented Programming): 
       -> objects are used primarily.
       -> code + data = object.
       -> developed to make it easier to develop, debugging , reuse and maintain.
“One programming language can be of all 3 types like- Python”
****Java Follows procedural and object oriented both types****
Static VS Dynamic Languages :
* Static Languages: 
 -> Perform type checking at compile time
 -> Errors will show at compile time
 -> Declare datatypes before use
 -> More control
* Dynamic Languages: 
 -> Perform type checking at run time.
 -> errors are shown at run time.
 -> No need to declare datatypes.
 ->Saves time in writing code but might
   give error at runtime. 

* Memory Management: 
 There are 2 types of memory Stack and Heap
When we declare a variable then the reference variable stored in stack
memory points to the object of that variable stored in heap memory.
For ex:- 𝑎 = 10
Here “a” is called reference variable, and “10” is the object of That reference
variable
 ==> Reference variable are stored in stack memory.
 ==> Heap memory stores the objects of reference variable. 


-> More than one reference variable can points to the same object.
-> If any changes made to the object of any reference variable that will be
   reflected to all others variable pointing to same object.
-> If there is an object without reference variable then object will be
   destroyed by “Garbage Collection”
